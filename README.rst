:Purpose:
    To make your life easier ofcourse!

Here you'll find all sorts of tools. Need help with organising your workplace and assignments and other things? I got you covered! Need to look up something quick, some refernce of some keyword? I got you covered! Need to share large code with others or probably you don't want to lose syntax midway? I got you covered! Do you want to be private but don't want to get into too much hassle of setting up proxy chains and changing DNS servers? Well **I GOT YOU COVERED !!**

You'll find all sorts of things here.
I'll try to keep this document updated as much as I can, like adding new tools that you might need etc.

Whatever sort of tools you may need I got you covered my friend :), you just keep on studying and growing your knowledge.

Most of the tools I've shared in this document here are either completely free or some part is free so that you can use it with no problem and upgrade to premium plans if want to! So you don't need to worry about spending your precious money on things which you could have got for free.

And yeah everything I share here is of high quality and completely secure so you don't need to worry about it. I know how important internet privacy and security is. I am kind of a freak about it, so I wouldn't want bad for you either :)

Well Let's Get Started!

TL;DR (Too long; Didn't read)
    I understand if you don't want to read this document :( and just want to get the links. All the links are neatly arranged in a table at the bottom of the document, for all platforms. *I have not included any links for desktop applications* because well you have browser, and every (almost) application listed here can be used in a browser.
    
*****************
TOOLS FROM GOOGLE
*****************

When this company doesn't need an introduction! If you want to say "look it up on the internet", what do you say?, "*Google it!*". Google is the most well known and one of largest tech companies today. While Google has several lines of products it is most well known for its powerful search engine.

Google is a trillion dollar company today. Well not exactly Google but Google's parent company **Alphabet** is! Yes, Google is a child company and in turn Google has several child company **YouTube** being one of the prime example.

Let's dive into the tools

Organisation apps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. `Google Keep - Notes and Lists <https://keep.google.com/>`_

        **Keep** is an app for note keeping and making todo lists for stuff. There is no character limit and you can type however long notes you want. You can even set reminders in this app so it also doubles down as a reminder application!. It's a really versatile and extremely easy to use application. 

        It is available on `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&hl=en_IN&gl=US&pli=1>`_, `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/in/app/google-keep-notes-and-lists/id1029207872>`_ and `Desktop Browsers <https://keep.google.com/>`_ completely free of cost.

2. `Google Tasks <https://tasksboard.com/>`_

        **Tasks** is an app for keeping track of tasks making to-do lists. Again it's a very verstaile and simple to use application. You can make *task groups*, *list tasks* that needs to be done, and you can also *give a description to each task* which is a feature I haven't seen in other apps like this usually.

        It is available on `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks&hl=en_IN&gl=US>`_, `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/in/app/google-tasks-get-things-done/id1353634006>`_ and `Desktop Browsers <https://tasksboard.com/>`_ completely free of cost.

3. `Google Calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/>`_

        **Calendar** is a well calendar application ofcourse. But it's not your any usual calendar application. It's a really sophisticated and neatly organised calendar application. You see the month has 30 days (I know some have 31, 28 and 29 as well so shhh...) and you ofcourse don't have something important every single day.

        **Google Calendar** app takes care of that and shows you only the important dates and events that you choose to see and groups all other redundant dates. It's so that you can just focus on what's important and not have to deal with other useless stuff. You can set important days in the app like birthdays, meetings etc, with timing. You can completely customize it your own liking :)

        It is available on `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&hl=en_IN&gl=US>`_, `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-calendar-get-organized/id909319292>`_ and `Desktop Browsers <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/>`_ completely free of cost.

4. `Gmail <https://mail.google.com/mail/>`_

        **Gmail** is an electronic mail (email) client. Well you already know what emails are so the what makes Gmail great is it's organisation and intelligent detection of emails. You can configure GMail to organise the mails for you in different categories, like Primary; includes all the important emails, Promotions; all those stupid spam offer letters which you'll never read, Social; useless notification emails from your attached social media platform like who commented or who liked on your video etc.

        It also has a really intelligent spam detection system and filters them out to the **SPAM** folder. Well sometimes mistakes happens so don't forget check your *spam folder* next time you feel like you're not receiving your important mail that you were supposed to!

        Psst...Psst... Do you want to know about a feature of GMail that you have been unaware of your whole life?! (well probably you know if you keep up to date with tech stuff)

        Are you getting promotional or just stupid random letter from services you don't even remember signing up for? Well there is a huge possibility that some service for which **YOU DID SIGN UP FOR** sold your data to third party services. But you don't know who that might be, because there IS no way to know.

        Well if you know how mails **(mails, not particularly emails)** are written, you write the address of the receiver of the mail on the letter. So if you click on the name of the sender of the email you'll get further info on who was it sent to.

        So you can append the name of the service you signed up for in your email-id with which you're signing up and next time you receive an email from a service you didn't sign up for you'll know exactly who to blame for it.

        For example I have an email id: ``privacy_example@gmail.com`` and I want to sign up on **Facebook** using this email-id, I'll just append Facebook to the email id so the id with which I'll sign up now is ``privacy_example+facebook@gmail.com`` and yes including the addition (+) symbol. Well if you did this with Facebook you'll get a lot of emails on this id as well everybody know what *Facebook does do your data*.

        Just to be clear you'll still receive all your mails on your original id, just in receiver's address you'll see the new id.

        It comes preinstalled on almost every device these days so yeah! It is available on `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm&hl=en_IN&gl=US&pli=1>`_, `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480>`_ and `Desktop Browsers <https://mail.google.com/mail/>`_ completely free of cost.

OFFICE APPLICATIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Office applications basically means text editing, table editing applications. Before I go list the applications I would like to tell you how is **Google's Office Suite** better than **Microsoft Office Suite**.

* Well First of all the whole **Google Office Suite** is free unlike **MS Office** which costs $179.99 or INR 14834.87(one-time fee), or for a home or student license $79.99 or INR 6592.82(onetime fee)
* **Google Office Suite** can work in the completely in the browser and doesn't need to be installed or anything, open your browser and have at it
* *Multiple users* can collaborate on one document at a single time, which makes the production faster
* You can export the created document in way more formats than MS Office
* Since **Google Office** is internet based you can edit on the go, anywhere anytime, doesn't matter

In the end it's completely up to you which one you want to use as per your convenience, honestly speaking I don't use either! I use `LibreOffice Suite <https://www.libreoffice.org/>`_ which is a completely free, and open source *Suite* of applications suited for all your needs. It's a nonprofit so it's donation based, well you ofcourse don't need to donate a single penny, they'll never ask you to nor force you to, but if you want you can.

LibreOffice is also the default *Office Suite* of **Linux Operating Systems**.

Let's look at the Google Apps for now though!

5. `Google Docs <https://docs.google.com/document/>`_

        **Docs** is a word processing application just like *MS Word*. You can do anything on Docs that you can do on Word with a little topping of collaboration which is a feature you won't find in Word!

        This also comes preinstalled on many devices these days. It is available on `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs&hl=en_IN&gl=US>`_, `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/in/app/google-docs-sync-edit-share/id842842640>`_ and `Desktop Browsers <https://docs.google.com/document/>`_ completely free of cost.

6. `Google Sheets <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets>`_
        
        **Sheets** is a spreadsheet application, in other words the application where you make all the tables.

        This also comes preinstalled on many devices these days. It is available on `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets&hl=en_IN&gl=US>`_, `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/in/app/google-sheets/id842849113>`_ and `Desktop Browsers <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets>`_ completely free of cost.

7. `Google Slides <https://docs.google.com/presentation>`_

        **Slides** is a presentation making application. You can make quick or detailed presentations on here.

        This also comes preinstalled on many devices these days. It is available on `Android <https://docs.google.com/presentation>`_, `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/in/app/google-slides/id879478102>`_ and `Desktop Browsers <https://docs.google.com/presentation>`_ completely free of cost.

8. `Google Drive <https://drive.google.com/>`_

        **Drive** is the home to all of your data associated with your **Google** *account*, whether it be email, calendar, reminders, your documents, your device backup(if you chose drive) and yeah anything associated with your Google account.

        You get 15 GB of free space in total by default. It's not a lot I agree, that's why if you make any documents using Google Documentation applications make sure to save it on your device rather than your *Google Drive*.

        If you don't want to worry about the storage problem, you can buy more storage which is a monthly subscription or an yearly subscription your call, check out the plan over on `Google One pricing plans <https://one.google.com/about/plans>`_. The maximum you can get is 2TB which is fairly a lot for a single user, but you can also share that storage with up to 5 others. Yeah, whichever plan you buy you can share with up-to 5 others.

UTILITY
^^^^^^^

9. `Google <https://wwww.google.com>`_
        
        Do I seriously need to give it any description? Well I already did earlier. It's one of most powerful search engine, if not the most. You've used it pretty much your entire life, haven't you! But have you ever though how to **USE GOOGLE**? While that may sound stupid it is not. I bet you've never learned to utilise the power of Google properly.

        Head over to `"How to search on GOOGLE" <https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/134479?hl=en>`_, and learn about how to utilise Google properly and there is a **Expert Search Tips** section, which shares some additional links, don't forget to check those ones out because those are the real juice of all this!

10. `Google Assistant <https://assistant.google.com/>`_

        Just hear me out!! I know she is extremely annoying and misinterprets the words you're using, but trust me the more you use her the better she'll get. She can do some really cool things and you can automate a lot of things using her.

        Activate her by saying, "Hey Google" or press your home button for 3 seconds, and ask her to, "Open Assistant Settings", trust me you'll not regret it. You'll see a whole load of different settings, explore each and every one of them, trust me it's worth your time.

        And for iPhone users, while you have **Siri** I know, but you can use Google Assistant as well if you want to! You know why Google has an upper hand over **Apple**? Because of the tremendous amount of analytical data Google has. If you don't know why that is useful, don't worry you'll learn about it in your studies.

And that was all there was from Google!!! Well ofcourse Google has a lot more to offer, a whole lot more but this is all you'll need for now. This is not a biography of Google, I am just here to share some tools with you to help on your journey.

And before moving ahead here's a Guide by Google itself on how to use it properly, it's guide for every tool by Google. Suit your and find what you need on "`Get Started With Google <https://guidebooks.google.com/get-started-with-google?hl=en-IN>`_"

There are other tech giants in the field as well. So let's look at some other useful tools you will need!

************************************
MORE UTILITY TOOLS BUT NOT BY GOOGLE
************************************

`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**GitHub** is a *Version Control System* aka VCS. 

What is a Version Control System?

Well you remember playing Mario or similar games where you'll get checkpoints along the way, so if you die; you start at your checkpoint rather than to have to go to the very start and do it all over again.

Version Control System does the same thing and keeps track of all versions of your project so if you mess up you can always roll back to the previous version of your project which was fine. Or you just feel like using the old version rather than the new one. VCS keeps track of the changes made in your project.

Well you don't get checkpoints, you make checkpoints yourself, however many you want and whenever you want.

GitHub is a cloud based VCS based on **Git** which is a VCS which works locally on your machine. You can keep track of your project locally and then after finishing the current version of the package you're working you can publish it directly on GitHub or any other VCS you want.

Yes there are other VCS services as well, `GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com/>`_ and `BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org/product>`_ are among the most popular with GitHub. GitLab is costly though, GitHub is free.

You can find other people's work on GitHub as well, some of the most popular open-source software (software which have their code available to the public for free) like `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ are on GitHub.

`Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Visual Studio Code is a text editor used to write code. It is one of the most popular and versatile code editor out there. It is completely free, and also open source. It has so many plugins in it's extension store that you'll just might get overwhelmed. The community is always building new extensions and also improving already existing ones. It supports any programming language you know of and the ones you don't.

Later on I will make a document in this repository with all the preferred configurations and extensions.

`Pastebin <https://pastebin.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is **Pastebin**? Let's hear it from the platform itself!

"Pastebin is a website where you can store any text online for easy sharing. The website is mainly used by programmers to store pieces of sources code or configuration information, but anyone is more than welcome to paste any type of text. The idea behind the site is to make it more convenient for people to share large amounts of text online."

It's essentially your clipboard which you can share with others online. It's simple, it's fast and it's secure. Best part about it is you don't really need to sign up to paste code on the website but you should otherwise you won't have access to the data other than that you'll be able see it later.

And yes it's completely free to use.

If you have any other questions about Pastebin, check out the `FAQ <https://pastebin.com/faq>`_.

`imgur <https://imgur.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**imgur** is a platform where people from all over the world can share images and GIFS. It is useful as you can share informative images with others just like you share text over **Pastebin**. It's pretty similar to Pastebin, difference is just that it's images and GIFS.

*******
PRIVACY
*******

The world wide web or internet is a boon to humanity. You basically have all the information you need available over the internet and to search through such a vast sea you have some ships that allow you to do so like **Google**.

But as good as it seems it is also a scary place if you're not careful. As I said above you've all the information in this world at the tip of your fingers, and that information includes *** your information*** as well!! You never know when the site you shared your personal data (including but not limited to your name, address, credentials, your banking info etc.) with will sell your data to other third parties who may not have the best intentions!

But luckily there are some good people in the world as well who constantly keep fighting bad people to protect you and your information. And I am here to share some tools developed by such good people.

Just before I move ahead if you use a laptop and it has a webcam you might want to cover it with black tape or who knows who might be watching you right now. Uncover it when you need to use the webcam other keep it covered. Modern laptops come with physical privacy shutters which help you with this, but if you don't have it just the black tape will suffice.

And yes **BLACK** in particular. Why? Well if you have read about how **light** works, then you might know that *Black* colour absorbs the most amount (or *wavelengths* for nerds) of light.

`Mozilla.org <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Mozilla** is not a software but a software foundation which is committed to ensure people's privacy on the internet. If you click on the title of this section, you'll be redirected to their menifesto which describes their purpose and goal.

When it comes to privacy there is no one else like **moz://a foundation** (yes, mozilla's logo looks like this spelling). They are whole heartedly committed to privacy and also **moz://a foundation** is a nonprofit organisation and runs on donations.

They have a few products which have a premium subscription but they still offer you a similar free plan.

Here is a `list of all products <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/>`_ offered by **moz://a foundation**.

Now let's take a look at other tools!

`DuckDuckGo <https://duckduckgo.com/about>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DuckDuckGo is a private search engine. It is really powerful search engine, but in contrast to **GOOGLE** it *doesn't collect any data** from you, and it's **private mode** is actually private unlike Google Chrome's **incognito mode**. Yeah *incognito mode* still collects the data, it's just that it doesn't save history but history can still be accessed by your internet provider.

If you want privacy use DuckDuckGo and you might as well make it your default search engine on all your browsers.

DuckDuckGo provides other services as well, a list of all that is offered by DuckDuckGo is:

* `DuckDuckGo Search Engine <https://duckduckgo.com>`_
* `DuckDuckGo Application <https://duckduckgo.com/app>`_ (extension for Browsers, and application for mobile devices)

DuckDuckGo offers an `Email Protection Service <https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/>`_. It blocks trackers in emails, and also help you to prevent yourself from getting spam mails. Click on the link and you can learn all about it. You can also check out the `FAQ <https://duckduckgo.com/email/faq>`_ for futher questions about it.

DuckDuckGo also provides `App Tracking Protection for Android <https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/>`_ which blocks most trackers lurking in your android applications. Unfortunately it's not available on iOS.

And that's all for **DuckDuckGo**, so go take control of your privacy with DuckDuckGo!

`Firefox Browser <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Firefox is a browser that is built for you by **Moz://a Foundation**. It is the second best browser in terms of anonymity and privacy. Umm... *second best*? What's the first one. You'll know about it in a moment.

Firefox is a browser for anyone and it respects your privacy. You can customize it however you want. I suppose you already know about it so there is no need to give it much description.

Firefox is also the default browser choice for all **Linux Operating Systems** as all linux systems are privacy oriented.

`Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tor is a VPN that protects your privacy and Tor Browser enables Tor VPN to be used. Tor isolates each visit of your on the web so that you cannot be followed back. Any cookies or browsing history is automatically cleared after you close the session.

You remember I said that Firefox was the second best browser? Because the first place goes to the **Tor Browser**.

Tor Browser was initially developed by US Naval Research Lab in 1990 to prevent their military data and it was later released to the public. Since 2006 Tor is being maintained by **The Tor Project Inc.**.

Tor browser routes your network through 3 relay networks. Well because of this it should also be noted that the speed to get your data get back to you is also slower in Tor since it is being routed through relay networks first.

**Keep in mind** that Tor is not your everyday browser so stick with **Firefox Browser**. Tor is not meant to be used by everyone for everyday work. It is generally used to access the deepest parts of the internet which is also referred to as **Deep Web**, which cannot be accessed through normal browsers.

What is Deep Web?

Well it houses all the data you see on the normal web or referred to as **Surface Web** and more. Deep Web is not a secure place and thus not for everyone. **Deep Web** also houses what's referred to as **Dark Web** which is quite small part of the **Deep Web** which houses all the bad stuff. Trust me you don't want to go there. Though cyber officials are not allowed there but bad people are lurking there too much. You never know who might be spying on you over there, it's not safe. **STAY AWAY**!

`Authy <https://authy.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authy is a **two factor authorisation (2FA)** cloud based service.

What is 2FA?

It is an additional layer of security for your logins. If you enable 2FA on your account, each time you sign in, you'll have to enter a unique six or sever digit code in addition to your password. It may sound like a hassle but it's a great way to secure you. Your authenticator generates such codes locally on your device which you have the authenticator on, these codes are time based and only valid for a couple of seconds then a new code is generated.

Why choose **Authy** and not **Google** or other services?

Authy is a really versatile and secure app. And it's cloud based so you can have it synced across multiple devices. Well that may sound insecure, but trust me it is secure. Each time you link a new device, you need to enter an OTP sent to you on your mobile number by Authy.

Other authenticators don't have this feature so if you accidentally delete your app or lose your device which you had the authenticator on. You're done for, there is absolutely no way to recover your accounts now, unless the service that you enabled the 2FA for has some additional authentication methods or they are willing to cooperate with you.

`Dashlane <https://www.dashlane.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dashlane is a **password manager**. It can store your password, your personal info, your payment info etc. It's really secure and reliable.

Dashlane is really cool! It can generate extremely strong passwords for you and store them securely inside the application. You don't need to remember a single password after you install Dashlane as it will autofill them for you everywhere you go. It can autofill pretty much anywhere on mobile devices and it can autofill for you on every website in your desktop as it is not available as a desktop application but rather a browser extension.

You can download it for free. With the free plan you can store up to 50 passwords in the application. But I suggest you to buy a premium plan which costs INR 49.99/month for individual plan or ~ INR 76/month for family plans which allows you to attach 10 seperate accounts to one single plan. So you can buy the family plan with your friends. It's really cheap.

With premium you get:

* Unlimited passwords
* Access on unlimited devices( with free plan you can only access dashlane on device)
* Secure notes (if you have any notes regarding that particular login like backup codes or something)
* Encrypted file storage
* Unlimited sharing
* Dark Web Monitoring (quoting from dashlane, "this tool scans the dark web for leaked personal data and helps you secure it)
* VPN (premium of HotspotShield VPN, can connect up to 10 devices)

Honestly speaking even I found out some new features about Dashlane Premium, when quoting this all from the dashlane app.

Trust me the premium is absolutely worth it!

That's all for this version of this Document. I'll be sure to add new tools which I think will be helpful to you in future. Below is a neat table of all the tools I listed here and all the relevant links.
